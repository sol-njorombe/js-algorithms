# Arrays

- Is a contagiously-allocated data structure. 
- With fixed sized data records, elements can be efficiently located based on index/address

## Adv of contiguously-allocated arrays
1. constant-time access given the index
2. space efficiency (there is no linking)
3. Memory locality efficient for iteration through the records

## Disadv
1. Fixed size and they cannot be resized
    - ArrayLists (Java) and slices (GoLang) solve this by moving the whole array into a new array of double the size. Half the items move once, quater the element twice, etc and therefore each of the elements moves only two times on average. The cost is amortized to O(n)
    - This may not guarantee the addition will always be constant as that might be the execution that involves copying over the array.

# Arrays operation time complexity

|  | Operation | Unsorted Array | Sorted Array |
| --- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 1 | search(L, k) | O(n) | O(log n)  - Binary Ssearch|
| 2 | insert(L, x) | O(n) | O(n) |
| 3 | delete(L, x) | O(1)* - known index | O(n) You have to move the rest |
| 4 | successor(L, x) | O(n) | O(1) |
| 5 | predecessor(L, x) | O(n) | O(1) |
| 6 | minimum(L) | O(n) | O(1) |
| 7 | maximum(L) | O(n) | O(1) |

# Details

In javascript everything is an object/dictionary/hash map. This means the underlying structure of the array is an object in which the index represent the key in the dictionary/hash map. This increases the speed of access and the capability by which they are accessed and manipulated. (*look into hash table implementation to understand why this can be faster* )

JS also tracks the indexes by tracking the last inserted array element and incrementing the index
