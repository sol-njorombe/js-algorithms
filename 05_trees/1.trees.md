# Binary Search Tree
| Operation | Time Complexity | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| search(x) | O(h) | h - height of the tree
| worst case search(x) | O(n) | insertion was on an ordered list
| min() | O(h) | left most node of the tree
| max() | O(h) | right most node of the tree
| traversal() | O(n) | Can be inOrder, preOrder, postOrder
| delete(x) | O(h) | requires at most 2 searches

The O(h) = O(log n)
