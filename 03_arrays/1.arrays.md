# Arrays operation time complexity

|  | Operation | Unsorted Array | Sorted Array |
| --- | --------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| 1 | search(L, k) | O(n) | O(log n)  - Binary Ssearch|
| 2 | insert(L, x) | O(n) | O(n) |
| 3 | delete(L, x) | O(1)* - known index | O(n) You have to move the rest |
| 4 | successor(L, x) | O(n) | O(1) |
| 5 | predecessor(L, x) | O(n) | O(1) |
| 6 | minimum(L) | O(n) | O(1) |
| 7 | maximum(L) | O(n) | O(1) |

# Details
Arrays will always be of fixed size. 

Some languages implement arrays as dynamic arrays, with varying sizes. This is achieved through the doubling of the size which ends up having an amotized cost on O(n). 
 
In javascript everything is an object/dictionary/hash map. This means the underlying structure of the array is an object in which the index represent the key in the dictionary/hash map. This increases the speed of access and the capability by which they are accessed and manipulated. (*look into hash table implementation to understand why this can be faster* )
