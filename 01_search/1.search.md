# search algorithms
Given an array and some value, find the value in the array

# Linear sort
loops through the whole array and tries to find the value from the first index to the last

Complexity O(n)

# Binary sort
Takes in a sorted array, then uses the divide and conquer rule to break the problem into a smaller problem. It divides the array into two and narrows the search on the most likely half. 

Complexity O(log n)
