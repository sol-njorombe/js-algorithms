# Queue
This a a FIFO(First In First Out) type of a data structure.

 

# Operations

1. *enqueue(x, q)* Insert item x at the back of the queue q
2. *dequeue(q)* Return (and remove) the front item from the queue q

# Implementation
 - Javascript arrays can be used as a queue by using the pop function for the queue and the shift for dequeue
 - A linked list would be a good candidate for such a data type. The head will always be updated on each insertion and the tail updated on each deletion.
