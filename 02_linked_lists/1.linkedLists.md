# Linked lists

- Each node is linked to the next using pointers

## Advantage over static array
1. Oveflow never occurs unless the memory is full
2. Insertion and deletions are simpler
3. Work well for large records

## Disadvantage over arrays
1. require extra space for pointers
2. Dont allow efficient random access of items
3. Arrays allow better memory locality and cache performance than random pointer jumping
