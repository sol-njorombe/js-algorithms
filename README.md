# JavaScript Algorithms

This project is meant for implementation of popular algorithms and data structures and perform algorithmic analysis on the given implementations

# Running the project
1. To install the project clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` to install all the required npm packages
3. To test **Time analysis** run `node timeAnalysis.js`
4. To run tests `npm test`
